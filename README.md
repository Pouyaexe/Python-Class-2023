# Python and Machine Learning Course

This repository contains the course materials for a Python and Machine Learning course. The course is designed for students who have little to no programming experience and want to learn Python and Machine Learning.

## Course Structure

The course is divided into 9 sessions:

1.  Introduction to Python
2.  Variables, Data Types, and Operators
3.  Control Flow and Functions
4.  Data Structures in Python
5.  Object-Oriented Programming
6.  Introduction to Machine Learning
7.  Supervised Learning
8.  Unsupervised Learning
9.  Neural Networks and Deep Learning

Each session covers a specific topic and builds upon the previous sessions. The sessions include lectures, examples, and exercises to help students learn the concepts.

## Getting Started

To get started with the course, clone the repository to your local machine:

bashCopy code

`git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-machine-learning-course.git` 

Each session has its own folder containing a README file with instructions on what topics will be covered, what examples will be given, and what exercises students should complete.

The course assumes that you have Python 3 installed on your machine. If you don't have Python 3 installed, you can download it from the official Python website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Prerequisites

To successfully complete the course, you should have:

-   Basic computer skills
-   Familiarity with the command line interface
-   Basic knowledge of algebra and statistics

## Resources

Throughout the course, we will be using the following resources:

-   Python 3
-   Jupyter Notebook
-   NumPy
-   Pandas
-   Matplotlib
-   Scikit-Learn
-   Keras

Links to the documentation for these resources will be provided in each session's README file.
